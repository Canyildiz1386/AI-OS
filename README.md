# AI-OS: An AI-Centric Operating System Interface

AI-OS is my vision of a modern operating system interface where artificial intelligence is at its core, not just an add-on. It reimagines how we interact with computers by making AI an integral part of the user experience.

Watch the demo video above to see AI-OS in action! The demo showcases:
- Natural language command processing in the terminal
- AI-powered file operations
- Modern desktop environment with draggable windows
- Real-time AI assistance

## 🌟 Vision

I believe the future of computing lies in natural, intelligent interfaces that understand user intent rather than just executing commands. AI-OS is an experimental platform that explores this vision by:

- Making AI the central interface between users and system functions
- Allowing natural language interactions with system components
- Creating an intuitive, Linux-inspired desktop experience
- Building a foundation for AI-first applications

## 🚀 Current Features

### Terminal with AI Command Interpretation
- Natural language command processing
- AI interprets user intent and converts it to system commands
- Traditional command-line interface when needed
- Supports file operations, app launching, and system queries

### Modern File Manager
- Clean, intuitive interface
- Create and edit text files directly
- Local storage with IndexedDB
- Seamless integration with AI commands

### Desktop Environment
- Linux-inspired UI with a modern twist
- Draggable windows with minimize/maximize
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Dark theme optimized for long sessions

## 🛠 Technical Stack

- Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript, CSS3 with modern features
- Backend: Python with AI integration
- Storage: Browser's IndexedDB for client-side persistence
- AI: Integration with OpenAI-compatible APIs

## 🔄 Development Status

This is an active project under development. Current focus areas:
- Expanding AI capabilities
- Adding more system functionalities
- Improving UI/UX
- Enhancing file system operations

## 🎯 Future Plans

- Multiple AI models support
- Rich text editor
- File type previews
- Custom themes
- More desktop applications
- Extended command set
- Multi-window management

## 🤝 Contributing
